This paper explains how to use Base SAS® software to create custom multi-sheet Microsoft Excel workbooks.  You learn step-by-step techniques for quickly and easily creating attractive multi-sheet Excel workbooks that contain your SAS® output by using the SAS® Output Delivery System (ODS) Report Writing Interface (RWI) and the ODS destination for Excel.  The techniques can be used regardless of the platform on which SAS software is installed.  You can even use them on a mainframe!  Creating and delivering your workbooks on demand and in real time using SAS server technology is discussed.  Although the title is similar to previous presentations by this author, this presentation contains new and revised material not previously presented.
